hAMRonization - Harmonization of output file formats of antimicrobial resistance detection tools 
=======================================
Description
-----------
hAMRonization is a project aiming at the harmonization of output file formats of antimicrobial resistance detection tools. 

The inclusion criteria was open-source tools for specifically AMR detection.

The following tools are currently included:
* abricate
* AMRFinderPlus
* ariba
* Groot
* RGI (for complete and draft genomes)
* RGI BWT (for metagenomes)
* staramr
* resfams
* staramr
* Resfinder
* sraX
* DeepARG (requires singularity)
* CSSTAR
* AMRplusplus
* SRST2 
* KmerResistance

Excluded tools:
* mykrobe (needs variant specification to be parseable)
* pointfinder (needs variant specification to be parseable)
* SEAR, ARG-ANNOT (no longer downloadable)
* RAST/PATRIC (not easily runnable on CLI)
* Single organism/or resistance tools (e.g. Kleborate, LREfinder, SSCmec Finder, U-CARE, ARGO)
* shortBRED, ARGS-OAP (rely on usearch which isn't open-source)

To generate comparable result files, all tools are being run in a Snakemake pipeline installing fixed versions of the tools from conda on execution.

To exclude any particular tool just comment out the relevant line in `Snakefile` e.g. to remove mykrobe comment out `expand("results/{sample}/mykrobe/report.json", sample=samples.index),`.

Installation 
------------

First clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/pha4ge/hAMRonization_workflow`

This pipeline depends on snakemake, conda, build-essentials, git, zlib-dev, and unzip. 
If you have conda installed, please run:

`conda env create -n hamronization_workflow --file envs/hamronization_workflow.yaml` 

and 

`conda activate hamronization_workflow`

All further dependencies will be installed via conda on execution.

If you want to run `DeepARG` you need to have a working `singularity` install on your system and invoke `--use-singularity --singularity-args "-B $PWD:/data"` when running snakemake (otherwise comment out this input to the cleanup rule in the `Snakefile`).


Execution
---------

To execute the pipeline, go to the main folder of the cloned repository, adapt the sample sheet as well as the config file to your needs and call with the number of jobs you want to run.

`snakemake --configfile config/config.yaml --use-conda --jobs 2 --use-singularity --singularity-args "-B $PWD:/data"` 

Testing
-------

If you want to test the pipeline locally on a single TB isolate you can use the
`run_test.sh` script to create a clean conda instance, download the dbs, and download
the test data. 

If you've already downloaded the test data you can just run to execute the pipeline:

`snakemake --configfile config/test_config.yaml --use-conda --jobs 1 --use-singularity --singularity-args "-B $PWD:/data"`

Docker
------

Alternatively, the workflow can be run using docker.  Given the collective quirks of the bundled tools this will probably be easier for most users.

Unfortunately, deeparg is only really runnable as a container, and snakemake uses singularity, the docker version has to be run in a privileged manner i.e. `docker run --privileged`.

If you are unable to run docker in privileged mode then you can just comment out the deeparg target in the main `Snakefile` (`expand("results/{sample}/deeparg/output.mapping.ARG", sample=samples.index),`).

First get the docker container:

`docker pull finlaymaguire/hamronization:1.0.1`

You can execute it in a couple of ways but the easiest is to just mount the folder containing your reads and running it interactively:

`docker run -it --privileged -v $HOST_FOLDER_CONTAINING_ISOLATES:/data finlaymaguire/hamronization:1.0.1 /bin/bash`

If our isolate data is in `~/isolates` the command to interactively run this container and get a bash terminal would be:

`docker run -it --privileged -v ~/isolates:/data finlaymaguire/hamronization:1.0.1 /bin/bash`

Then point your `sample_table.tsv` to that folder, entries for this example would be:

```
species biosample       assembly        read1   read2
Mycobacterium tuberculosis      SAMN02599008    /data/SAMN02599008/GCF_000662585.1.fna  /data/SAMN02599008/SRR1180160_R1.fastq.gz       /data/SAMN02599008/SRR1180160_R2.fastq.gz
Mycobacterium tuberculosis      SAMN02599009    /data/SAMN02599009/GCF_000662586.1.fna  /data/SAMN02599009/SRR1180161_R1.fastq.gz       /data/SAMN02599009/SRR1180161_R2.fastq.gz
```

Then specify your `config.yaml` to use this `sample_table.tsv` and execute the pipeline from bash in the container by activating the top-level environment:

`conda activate hamronization_workflow`

Then the workflow:

`snakemake --configfile config/config.yaml --use-conda --cores 6 --use-singularity --singularity-args "-B $PWD:/data"`

*WARNING* You will have to extract your results folder (e.g. `cp results /data` for the example mounted volume) from the container if you wish to use them elsewhere.  

Note: kma/kmerresistance fails without explanation in the container (possibly zlib related, although adding the zlib headers didn't solve this). It is commented out for now.

Links to data and corresponding metadata need to be stored in a tab separated sample sheet with the following columns:
`species biosample       assembly        reads   read1   read2`
